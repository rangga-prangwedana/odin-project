    <h3>Absolute and Relative Links</h3>
    
    <p>Generally, there are two kinds of links we will create</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Links to pages on other websites on the internet</li>
        <li>Links to pages located on our own websites</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Absolute Links</h4>
    <p>Links to pages on other websites on the internet are called absolute links. A typical absolute link will be made up of the following parts: protocol://domain/path. An absolute link will always contain the protocol and domain of the destination. We’ve already seen an absolute link in action. The link we created to The Odin Project’s About page earlier was an absolute link as it contains the protocol and domain. https://www.theodinproject.com/about</p>
    <h4>Relative Links</h4>
    <p>Links to other pages within our own website are called relative links. Relative links do not include the domain name, since it is another page on the same site, it assumes the domain name will be the same as the page we created the link on. Relative links only include the file path to the other page, relative to the page you are creating the link on. This is quite abstract, let’s see this in action using an example.</p>

    <p>Prepending ./ before the link will in most cases prevent such issues. By adding ./ you are specifying to your code that it should start looking for the file/directory relative to the current directory.</p>
